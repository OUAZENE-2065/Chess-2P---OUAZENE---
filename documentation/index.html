        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The main objective in chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means the king is in a position to be captured ('in check') and there is no legal move that the player can make to escape the threat of capture on the next move.</p>

        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <p>At the start of the game, the chessboard is laid out with each player's pieces set up in the following positions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Back row (from left to right): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook</li>
            <li>Front row: Pawns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Piece Movement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves any number of squares in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
            <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
            <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves one square forward (two squares on its first move); captures diagonally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Moves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Castling:</strong> A special move involving the king and a rook. The king moves two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king.</li>
            <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur immediately after a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it is promoted to another piece (typically a queen).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>End of the Game</h3>
        <p>The game can end in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Checkmate:</strong> One player's king is in check and there is no legal move to escape.</li>
            <li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> The player to move has no legal moves and their king is not in check.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw:</strong> The game can also end in a draw by mutual agreement, insufficient material to checkmate, or the fifty-move rule (no pawn moves or captures in the last fifty moves).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="rules">
        <h2>Chess Rules</h2>
        <p>The game follows the standard rules of chess. Here are some key points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player takes turns to move one piece.</li>
            <li>The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.</li>
            <li>Special moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are supported.</li>
